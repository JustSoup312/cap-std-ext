# Extension APIs for cap-std

See [cap-std](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std).

This crate will aim to migrate extension APIs from
[openat-ext](https://docs.rs/openat-ext/latest/openat_ext/index.html).

And also add other helpers for e.g. [Command].  See https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rustix/issues/100
